TL;DR: The MIT license still requires you to include the original unmodified license file
when re-using any part of the project, and by doing so credit the original author.
Prefer taking inspirations instead, so your work is not purely derivative. That way, you'll fully understand
how things work and will be not just be copying stuff from the internet like some AI bot.
